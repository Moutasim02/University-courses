Aggregation -> Asymmetric, Transitive, Weak relationship
Composition -> A variant of aggregation, Strong relationship, a-kind-of

Qualification -> query... 

Delegation -> (Has a) A process of passing responsibility to another object (We will have the other 
object class as instance variable in another class)

Inheritance risk comes with the polymorphism where a subclass can falsely change the behaviour and break
the contract between super and sub classes.
