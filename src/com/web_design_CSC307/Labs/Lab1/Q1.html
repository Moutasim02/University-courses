            Water pollutants come from either point sources or dispersed sources. A point source is a pipe or channel, such as those used for discharge from an industrial facility or a city sewerage system.<br>
            A dispersed (or nonpoint) source is a very broad, unconfined area from which a variety of pollutants enter the water body, such as the runoff from an agricultural area
