#Java Arrays
- Starts from 0
- If the size of an array is n, then the last element of the array will be at index n-1.
- To get the elements of and array, use a loop. (for, for each, etc...)

#Multidimensional Arrays
- A multidimensional array is an array of arrays. That is, each element of a multidimensional array is an array itself.
  For example:

```
double[][] matrix = {
	  {1.2, 4.3, 4.0}, 
          {4.1, -1.1}
};
```
- First bracket refers to the row
- Second bracket refers to the column
